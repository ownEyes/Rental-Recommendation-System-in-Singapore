"AC blowing on bed,",NEGATIVE

"No aircon in dining room. Lily Room beautiful. Watched a kingfisher depleting small fish stock from lily pond for over an hour. This could explain why Eddie's ""frog symphony"" was a solo act the night I was there. Bus  24 to airport cheap and easy $1.90 Singapore dollars.",NEUTRAL
Super okay. Very accomodating! ,POSITIVE
"It's near to Singapore Expo. No shop, convenient store and restaurant around the area. It's residential and quiet area though. Only one bathroom. However, lucky to have two toilets for all six rooms guess.",NEUTRAL
"very hospitable, very friendly and helpful staff....but i think their management is in transition as the night time manager didn't know how to approve my reservation alteration from Airbnb as the room turned out to be very close to traffic and people walking by the din made it near impossible for a light sleeper like me....",NEGATIVE
"Host is very friendly, location is walking distance to haji. About 15 minutes walk to Bugis Junction.",POSITIVE
Decent place for a short stay. Staff was friendly and I enjoyed my stay for one night.,POSITIVE
"I personally didn't hear any street noise, but my unit was facing the back. Weekly cleaning is provided but not for the towels, so you need to wash those yourself if you have a long stay. The host Jarwin was responsive and friendly!",POSITIVE
Value for money place to stay over,POSITIVE
You can expectto have a good stay here.,POSITIVE
I thought the room will be bigger With the kitchen I would prefer if they would heads up to me that the room level they giving me is not a lift landing cause i had big bags with me had to carry one flight stairs  Thanks to kenneth and irean with my bags. Overall had a pleaseant stay,NEUTRAL
"Nancy was friendly and helpful, and the accommodation was conveniently located. Given the quality of the lodging, however, the rental was expensive.",NEUTRAL
It was nice????,POSITIVE
Would go back there any time.,POSITIVE
Bang for your buck (especially how expensive Singapore can be),POSITIVE
It was near on bus and mrt station.,POSITIVE
Location isn't great but MRT is nearby along with hawker centers and convenient stores. Good for visiting locals and tourists willing to take public transportation. ,NEUTRAL
"Nanda's instructions are very clear and went out of his way to help us store luggage at the location. Didn't realise the street was the actual red district and often we'd come home late at night, so it felt quite  uneasy. Nevertheless, the place is very conveniently placed near the train line and made transportation easy.",NEUTRAL
"Pros: - Justin is very polite and gave us the check in instructions was very detailed - Helpful Nympha who stays at the floor above attended to our questions and needs (more hangers, aircon servicing) - Tiong Bahru estate in general is a chill and convenient place to stay in Cons - Room not sound proofed well, could hear occasional noises from outside the room and beneath the building - En-suite toilet door was creaky and couldn't be closed completely from the outside - Aircon was not working well when we first arrived, but after the problem was brought up the next day, it got resolved by the night.",NEUTRAL
"Good Things: Condo is great, has pool, gym, sauna. Very nice environment and usually not crowded. Security guard and workers are very nice. Bad things: The flat is basically an only ""airbnb place"", so all people there are airbnb guest. They were noisy, and would make noise at night until 4am EVERYNIGHT. We had around 8 people sharing the flat.  So was crowded. Bathroom is VERY dirty, gotta clean that. Smelling like public toilet. Shower was broken.  Overall, fair for the price.",NEGATIVE
Good but there? ?s others? ? hair beside the bed,NEGATIVE
"I arrived after midnight when there was no reception and I didn't know which room to go. We had to call them and finally got a bed at 2 pm then I was moved to another room the next day. Though the place is close to the main sights, so the location is fine",NEUTRAL
Location and cleanliness is acceptable.  it is mix room and noisy is expected,NEGATIVE
A lot of steps in room. Sharp edges. Carefully tread.,NEGATIVE
Other facilities are available except for the small rooms.,NEUTRAL
"Good service, but it can sometimes be noisy.",NEUTRAL
if u drive there wnt be a prob.. groceries can be bought at hdb nearby..!!,POSITIVE
It? ?s good if the client can check in at 12pm,POSITIVE
I hope you be more cooperative.,NEGATIVE
"Overall still a pleasant experience. Hotel is very convenient, located at city center. Some pointers to improve: 1. WiFi cannot connect from the room 2. TV no signal cannot watch  3. Unable to change room",NEUTRAL
Everything went smoothly from the first day to the last day. Will try to go back next time.,POSITIVE
nice place. very good location. but room is very narrow.,NEUTRAL
"Our stay was good except when the AC couldn't cool the room. I had to ask the staff for an electric fan. Since they were so polite and friendly, I'm giving them 4 out of 5 stars.",NEUTRAL
We didn? ?t realise this was a short stay. Staff were helpful though,NEUTRAL
...try yourself,NEUTRAL
"Not bad, quite nice but hopefully the price can lower just abit ^",NEUTRAL
Worth the short stay and nap in between work,POSITIVE
Good for short stay. Only thing is no shelter if coming in raining.,NEUTRAL
"Ling is very nice lady, quit helpful.",POSITIVE
The location is very near to MRT Jalan Besar,POSITIVE
"I recommend this place for it's great location in Chinatown, close to a lot of famous landmarks in Singapore. The only thing I didn't like was the check-in, it requires you to download an app to do so and follow a bunch of steps, plus I personally experienced several bugs during the process. I know Singapore is all about technology and innovation but that was a bit too much for me, and I work in the tech industry",NEUTRAL
"In general, it? ?s a great location. In Little India, directly next to train. Walkable or trainable throughout the city. The rooms don? ?t have any windows. On one side it is good for sleeping, on the other feels a bit closed. It? ?s a bit pricey but not that out of line with other SG prices. But in general facilities are nice and I would stay again if I needed. FYI: ? ?Alex? ? isn? ?t a real person. It? ?s just a big company running an AirBnB as a short stay hotel.",NEUTRAL
"Looks like pictures, good location lots of places to eat nearby also close to MTR. This is like a hostel we were on second floor and near kitchen so had smell of food in hallway and room. Rooftop had a good bar and place for a snack, not attached to hotel.",NEUTRAL
bring ur own tissue,NEGATIVE
Good place to work but it get's occasionally noisy at times. Amenities and space are decent at its price point.,NEUTRAL
"Pictures did look nicer than the accommodation, as the bathroom for example had some bits that could do with repair but not bad. Busy road is just downstairs, so be aware if light sleeper. Location close to MRT, Chinatown, convenience store/supermarket and eateries.",NEUTRAL
"The listing look exactly like the picture. 2 things might need to be improved: 1. The aircond is lower than 2nd floor and we sleep in 2nd floor feel like no aircond. 2. May consider to add a air purifier near the toilet, otherwise if someone use the toilet 2nd floor odor very bad. Check in was smooth. The room is clean.",NEUTRAL
"Good location, bus stop just in front of the apartment. Overall, it? ?s okay.",NEUTRAL
Good stay in a good location.,POSITIVE
"I was surprise that the place was quiet. It is not a deluxe apartment because it needs a table and chairs we had to eat on a small coffee table. no glasses,only one knife, 2 mugs, 2 plastic plates, electric kettle, rice cooker, one pot and one pan . They provided one towel each, shampoo & conditioner, TP. They should provide a power strip because there are not enough plugs. there isn't a door in the bedroom so there is too much light , it needs curtains in the living room. The air conditioning worked fine and is needed! The front desk ladies were nice but it is messy and cluttered.",NEUTRAL
"Great location, needs better internet connectivity",NEGATIVE
"Great location, tram, shops and food all very close. Easy to find. The bed was very comfortable and clean however the room needs maintenance. Shower was not clean, tiles not clean and mould noticeable to ceiling. Room was small but it is as described in description, AC worked great.",NEUTRAL
