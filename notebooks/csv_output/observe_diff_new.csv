- Justin is very polite and gave us the check in instructions was very detailed

Bad things: The flat is basically an only ""airbnb place"", so all people there are airbnb guest. They were noisy, and would make noise at night until 4am EVERYNIGHT. We had around 8 people sharing the flat.  So was crowded.
