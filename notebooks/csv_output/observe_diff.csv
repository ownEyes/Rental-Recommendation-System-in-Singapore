337,337,"I would recommend the room for a stay in Singapore of an intermediate duration if you're not sensitive when it comes to cleanness
A definite plus is the location in an authentic HDB with several means of transportation available. Redhill MRT station is a 15-minute-walk away. However, you'll usually be much faster if you take the bus at Opp Pacific Tech Centre which is just a five-minute-walk away or, if you're lucky, the line 63 which departs right in front of the house works for you.
The main issue is the low hygienic standard. Joyce had announced that the commonly used rooms (esp. bathrooms and kitchen) would be cleaned weekly. However, the toilets were clearly not cleaned once during my entire stay of over a month. The mix of pee stains and pubic hair was downright disgusting.
In my opinion, this can only be excused by the relatively low price compared to other airbnbs. However, if you are planning a stay of several months you'll easily find a clean,  modern condominium with a pool and a gym for a lower rate in the respective facebook-groups etc.",0.6904327670370229,2.6479037267080745,3.0375013187876307,0.0469415202187937,0.0573606854455889,0.999968647956848,NEGATIVE,0.0591614906832298,0.0998365277030175,0.5956977943356174,0.4725672877846791

Bonus: The Newton Food Centre is a short walk! And there's a washing machine on premises.

Cons: 1) The kitchen does not appear to be newly renovated. Faulty stove, and refrigerator needed to be replaced while I was there. According to the host, the holiday interfered with delivery of a new fridge, so it was wrapped in bungee cord for the entirety of my 7 night stay, which was unfortunate. 2)  Communication with the host was cumbersome and created some difficulty initially. I think providing options other than Viber to communicate important info--such as Skype calls or calling card calls--would have been helpful.

Its rather clean but the kitchen lacks microwave and the stove doesn't work although we've tried a couple of times and even asked the host about it. My in laws couldn't heat up the food that they bought back. However, the room is big and clean although dark. My in laws said the bed is comfortable and they slept well. The host is difficult to deal with. She demands a lot as a host based on my experiences throughout the years and across countries. She's the first host to request for me to send scanned passport details before arrival which made me uncomfortable. When I asked why its necessary, she said its legal requirement (which she can't pinpoint which section and unable to direct me to a website for me to check when I asked for it), that I booked the room for my in laws and not staying there myself (she shouldn't have accepted the booking if it makes her uncomfortable) and that she wouldn't be in Singapore to check us in (so be in Singapore?). I relented and emailed her my-laws' passport details to stop the long chain of communication and she promised to send me EIGHT emails regarding check in details. After she sent FIVE (each of the email containing only ONE or TWO photo/document), she requested (yet again) for me to send my in laws' contact number so she can liase with them personally. She really got on my nerves with her endless requests because of her own choice of not being in SG and confirming my booking knowing I won't be staying there. I told her my in laws are old and are not tech savvy and do not have access to internet as often as I do.

768,768,"All I have to say about my stay has been said in the few negative reviews I found.
I am seriously baffled by the generally positive comments on this place. I suppose for young backpackers who are ready to endure Thai hostels, this is good enough.
First and most important, it is a run-down, shabby appartment. Wherever I looked or went, it was messy, dirty (beyond the immediate surface), old and shabby. My sense is that the host actually does not live here -- she was in Australia my entire stay, 10 days -- and simply milks the asset with the help of a ""cleaner"". No tidying up of the place, no maintainance at all (for at least 10 years, perhaps 20), only superficial cleaning, change of bed sheets and towels (mine was missing, by the way).
All the cheap talk by Elizabether about ""my humble, simple home"" should be discarded and replaced by: this is a cheap, run-down, shabby place, fine for backpackers who want to avoid hostels. Everyone else should look elsewhere.
Finally, the host herself. She is absent but nonetheless a control freak. She messages constantly and wants to talk, uselessly, including before you board your flight to Singapore (?!). I had to stop her. And she's awfully mean, constantly mentioning the price of electricity; she wanted to charge $5 to use a non-heating washing machine, for which you have to unfold a hose into the shower: seriously?

786,786,"Pros: safe, excellent location, really close to a bunch of the best museums, the famous Raffles hotel, on a historic Hainanese street with many bars, excellent and diverse restaurant options within a block’s walk, and near a bus stop with access to anywhere you want to be basically.  Concierge service is so responsive and friendly and complimentary laundry is a big win especially after sweaty days. 
Cons: Most alarming con the apartment is the shower situation or lack thereof. If all you want after a long day of sweating in Singapore’s relentless heat is a nice shower and the insurance of feeling clean, do NOT come to this apartment. It actually ruined the trip a bit for me even though the  concierge service did offer different apartments after I asked for help, my trust was already broken so I didn’t want to be troubled with another move and a similarly awful shower situation, given they don’t show pictures of the shower in any other apartment either. The rain forest shower head is not connected to the heated water line and the nozzle shower head has extremely weak water pressure, like you honestly might be better of buying a bucket and filling it with warm water and using it to assist your cleaning routine that way. 
The apartment is small despite it being a loft. It is not fun to walk up and down the stairs to your bed after a long day of walking or a stiff legged morning.

The room was okay and clean. Bathrooms were small / cubicles and joined with the toilet. There was a cubicle assigned for ladies only but it seemed some male tenant also use it cause there were always sprinkles of urine on the seats and it was all over, not typically a female would do. The common courtesy was for him to not use the female toilet and to lift the seat up before peeing. Again, it was not on the host but the lack of courtesy of the other tenants. The prompt on the airbnb was a vibrant social environment but I found that the guest house was rather quiet, again it is depend on the tenants. Some of the tenants I saw was middle aged guy or workers, unsure of their nationality. I seldom see 20-30s y.o people here, but then again like I said it was fairly quiet. The host did add me on their tenant whatsapp group. Barely anyone said anything. It would be more fun if indeed the tenants can get to know each other.

The bad thing: everything else (if you are sensitive to noise).
 
-It is very expensive for what you get
-HDB flat, meaning that it is old, walls are very thin, you can hear water running down the pipes, AC making noises and windows will not block any outside noise
-Not allowed to have any guests ever
-Was told twice that I was not allowed to cancel (even by Airbnb support)
-8 rooms and 2 bathrooms
-My first room was nice itself, but I had knocking sounds from pipes/airconditioning every night (was told to just use earplugs, which I did until my ears were sore)
-Second room was also noisy
-I had serious issues sleeping for 5 weeks and eventually had to leave the place (which was a hassle. Also: when I did, I saw that all my (even unopened!) groceries had been thrown out already. I did not understand why)

The dry setting does not work and makes the air smell even worse. Our clothes were never able to fully dry because they would just absorb all the moisture in the air again. We were eating a packet of crispy crackers and after only 15 minutes being exposed to the air, the crackers were moist and no longer crispy.
The bed sheets were old and the fabric was very pilled. And because of the dampness, they felt so dirty that we had to buy new ones. Hopefully future guests can enjoy them.
The bathroom floor has pipes running along the wall, and there must be a leak somewhere because a puddle of water collected on the floor between the toilet and the sink at least three times during our week-long stay.

The place was simple and clean, and overall a good value for the money. We booked last minute and it was the most economical option while still in a good location.  However, there were two areas for improvement: (1) Singapore is quite humid and so was the apartment.  It would have really helped to have a dehumidifier in the room. (2) We needed to check in early and check out late because of our flight times. In my experience AirBnB hosts are quite flexible with this, except if there is another guest already in the apartment or coming. Our host charged $10/hr for each hour early check in and each hour late check out. This was the first time I experienced this and does not seem the match the ethos of AirBnB.

I told Paul that the cleaning people could get into my room, put my few things somewhere and then I would come to collect my stuff before 3 pm. Paul proposed me to pay for one more night or at least pay $50 because he said that the cleaning people were there waiting for me, the checkout time was 12, my room door was locked and they couldn't go in to clean (no duplicate key? what if a guest loses the key?). 

I arrived at Paul's house at 2.30 PM, rushing from the hospital still in a difficult health condition.

2319,2319,"If you want to spend some time exploring the East Coast, this is a convenient location. There are several bus lines servicing the neighborhood and plenty to eat, see, and do nearby. Unfortunately, the room itself was a letdown. At our agreed upon arrival time, the host was not there and the key to the room had not been left with the restaurant staff downstairs. We had to wait more than half an hour to be let into the room. No apology was offered. When we struggled to connect to the WiFi (which was spotty throughout our stay), the host shrugged it off; he said, rather arrogantly, that his computer was working so the problem must be ours. We eventually got it to work on our own, but only by using a VPN. A caring host would have helped his guests resolve the issue. Our bigger problem with the room, however, was the noise. From about 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., the host's downstairs restaurant blasts clubby lounge-y chillax New Age music. You will wake up to it and you will (try to) go to sleep to it. The host claims to have ""soundproofed"" the rooms; whatever he has done doesn't make a difference. The bass is so loud on the music he plays, it shakes the floor and walls. If this weren't bad enough, the guest in the room next to ours was blasting pounding techno music well after midnight. When we complained to the host, he said he'd already left for the night and that we should knock on the guest's door and deal with it ourselves. How's that for professionalism? On the plus side, the room itself gets good natural light, the A/C works well, the shower stays hot-ish for about 10 minutes (long for Asia), and it has some cool vintage furnishings. But we advise you to read the amenities list very closely, as there are none. No blowdryer, no clock, no water glasses, no toiletries, no garbage bag in the garbage can, not even a soap dish to hold the soap you have to buy yourself. There's also no door or curtain blocking the toilet; if you're traveling as a couple, plan for your partner to hear and see everything. One other thing: The listing here fails to mention the room's mice infestation. We spotted two poison trays and a huge glue trap beneath the bed and had the pleasure of listening to them scratch and chew all night long. Sigh.

2325,2325,"The reason why you should book this
1. Located in very centered among famous local resturant. Everything just walking distance. 
2. Cappuccino in rabbit carrot gun is so devine, best coffee in sg so far
3. Great opportunity staying in shophouse which quite eccentric. Feeling like you run away. 
4. Lord Trenchard and his staff is amazing host. Respond fast n assist me every step of the way
Disadvantages for this place
1. Floor made of old wood and wall is really thin. So I heard guest next door walked back with cracking sound n heard every songs on their playlists in middle of the night. N like other review said. I got wake up service from music downstairs start from 8 am-10 pm. Like clockwork. You probably don't feel private from this point. 
2. No amenities
3. Clean up service wasn't daily during my stay. 
4. Not quite convenient commute to downtown

The place is actually very near to airport, around SGD 7 by Uber from the airport in the daytime or 3 bus stations away. We arrived in midnight and cost around SGD 14. The maid - Susan was quite helpful.  
If you are looking for the nearest MRT, probably a good 20 mins walk or a 10 mins walk plus 1 min bus ride. 
The room and the house is quite match with the photos provided. Worth to mention the host seems to be a devoted Buddha/ Zen collector, if your religious against any of that, probably think twice.  
The whole house is integrated and probably inspired by mother nature , lots of plants and insects as you can imagine. We found there are some lovely ants in the bathroom. ( we did not kill any of it as we thought this might against the spirit of Buddhism) 
We had some issue with the mattress, felt very itchy on our back in the middle of the night. Not sure what causes it as I am no expert but would guess a pest control will help. 
In short, if you love nature and need a private sanctuary for meditation, this might be your choice. 
However, if you are a weekend traveler or just passing by the country and want more access to the city, try to find somewhere near Bugis or China Town, not here.

3561,3561,"Felicia is a very attentive host and tries to fix any issues very promptly. Unfortunately during our stay, we had a problem with a mouldy smell throughout the apartment which made us feel a little bit sick. We alerted Felicia to the problem and she replaced the bed sheets and de-odorised the apartment for us almost immediately. It did help, but there was still a lingering drainage smell that I don't think could really be fixed easily. As a result, we tried to stay out of the apartment as much as possible during our visit there.

Location of the apartment is fantastic and easy to get to the MRT to go anywhere in Singapore. The size of the apartment is decent even if it was a little out-dated, but comfortable for a family of three. The pool was really good for our little boy to swim in as well.

Overall, I can't honestly say we enjoyed our stay that much because of the smell issue and considering what we paid, we did feel rather disappointed.

One living room that everybody's stay there,Paul,Paul's friends and the others to watching t.v. One common kitchen. One common w.c ( with several smells) and a door to your room. One very small room with a medium-sized bed. Absolutely dark (no day ligt) I have some photos of the < extra big bed> That's all. You can't stay at the room Just for an uncomfortable sleep. The bathroom is outside of the room and you listen everybody's to....... You don't have private life. You have to put on your clothes to go to the bathroom or to the kitchen if there not occupied from Paul's family.

After few hours sleep in the morning I was asking the Paul if it's possible to cancel the reservation for the rest of the days without any charge.  Because if you read carefully some where says for a common w.c. but here everything are common. You thought that you going to a high flor in a Fantastic serviced apartment with a private balcony and you get a dark hole just to sleep.

I had pay 350 euros for 3 nights and he ask me 100 euros plus because the price for the king size bed is for one person and I bring and my wife!!!!!Everybody's have an extra charge for more than 2 persons Paul knows all of these and that's why he have so strong rules and for the cancellation 7 days 50%!!!!! I meet some other with bad feed back for Paul's place bat disappear from the site . That's why I said is a well done trap.

Firstly and most important trait in the hospitality business is giving a warm welcome to the guests, honestly the welcome completely lacked this bit and followed by instructions which almost sounded like orders.
Secondly, when we asked for coffee cups during breakfast we were questioned about the cups taken couple of hours earlier. Indians have an habit of drinking coffee early in the morning and once after/during breakfast. I didn't understand the need to Sulk to give cups. For a moment I felt thinking to myself if I was staying for free. 
Thirdly, Since they charge extra 15 SGD per person, I think the breakfast should be better. As travelers we would love to try the local cuisine but a very simple English breakfast doesn't translate into value for money.
Fourthly, this place is 50mins away from main attractions like Gardens by the Bay, Chinatown etc by MRT. As travelers you are bound to walk a lot at these attractions and getting back to this place is quite a daunting task if you had a tiring day.

However -- and this is a problem with the apartment managers Atas, not Koko -- the front desk service was a hit and miss. A couple of them were really nice and helpful including the indian dude. Others were rather loud and rough - perhaps better suited for backend work and not  front line customer service work. I once saw two of the front desk people talking loudly to each other in a foreign  language in the mid afternoon when there were guests/ residents - they may even have been arguing.

She lives near the venue and offered to help should I have need for anything else but I was already feeling guilty for the last minute requests. Besides, pretty much everything ran like clockwork and I didn't have need for anything else.

I think updated photos are needed of the apartment as its much more lived in now and there is a lot of clutter in the living room.

Cons:
1. Rude staff <you can find out for yourself :) >
2. The air conditioners were not working (felt like it was summer inside the room).
3. No internet inside the rooms.
4. Their bunk beds were noisy af (it might be embarrassing to the person you share the bed (double-deck) with.
5. Unlike other hostels they do not provide shower supplies such as shampoo etc and their towels were old and kind of dirty.

Cons:as the hotel face the reservoir, be prepared to live with insects, lizard and flying cockroaches at the balcony during the night time. Also, I don’t get why it why a guest would have to be charge for an extra drinking water that it’s usually free in a Hotel setting. Be prepared to get your own mineral water before checking in because the Nearby NTUC is closed for good. Otherwise, can consider grab mart or panda mart if you don’t drive. 
I didn’t have a good quality sleep for 2 nights because the room that was assigned to me was directly opposite of the guest lift, so you can imagine the amount of noise that I have to lived with it whenever ppl walk pass with their luggage. 
For the amount that I paid, I would have expect something better. At least a non chargeable drinking water.

The apartment is an old government housing which clearly shows its age. Room itself is not very clean. You won't have duvet to sleep in but only duvet cover (live like a Roman!), which made me feel quite uncomfortable.

5720,5720,"Betty and Fred were fantastic hosts! Thanks for hosting us!
We were a group of 3 friends and we stayed here due to the good location.  The apartment with 2 studios was ample room.  There is a washing machine you can use and a small kitchenette which you could prepare basic meals in.  Fred picked us up and helped us with the entire check-in procedure and was helpful in giving information regarding the area.  Betty is a very responsive host and will reply to messages very quickly.
There are 2 main negatives with the twin studio
1) the sofabeds are not long enough for an adult (1.5m with a headset of about 20cm width), but it may just fit a child/adolescent.  There is only one double bed in each studio so it would be suitable for 2 couples or 4 people who are willing to share the 2 beds.  You could fit 7 people as per the listing if it was 4 adults and 3 children.
2) The other main negative was that the toilet in the first studio is just a afterthought toilet/shower and built into the room as a shower recess with glass panels rather than an actual bathroom.  If someone is using the shower/toilet, the other person in the room can see them directly.  There is some frosting of the glass and a blind inside the shower/toilet recess to cover up but that is about it.
3) This is more for your information rather than a negative.  There is almost no noise isolation between the 2 studios as they are separated by a makeshift wall panel.  This may or may not be a problem but if you are only renting one of the studios and had someone you didn't know in the next studio, it could be an issue as conversations can be heard from the next studio.
We still had a great time and the location was perfect.  Hotels in Singapore tend to be quite small so this is definitely a good alternative as long as the above 3 points are not an issue for your group.

Would appreciate if they can keep the place tidy and clean the dishes, cutlery and utensils.Your sister said we were very detailed in our handover and appreciated the personalized tour / guide of the area which most host do not do.Hope you can mention: 负责人、人很好，地方很清静，交通方便，很靠近他们国庆日的表演地点和旅游胜地…… 价钱很公道，不要错过Something like that can?

5918,5918,"The first thing I noticed when I entered the apartment was how extremely small it is and that it looked nothing like the photos. There wasn't even space to put our bags so it's actually more recommended for solo travellers as it doesn't even fit couples. The room also had a very damp weird smell, combined by how dark the room is even with all the lights on, makes it feel like you're in a gas station motel. Our TV didn't work, it kept switching on and off but in the few ""good"" times it did, the remotes wouldn't work too. 
Our rooms were right next to the laundry area, so we were promised that by 10pm the washer and dryers would be turned off to all guest but for many nights we would wake up to the loud noises of the dryers at the wee hours of 3 and 4 am so we had to turn them off ourselves causing us a lack of sleep. I believe if you made a promise, you should keep it! I left the apartment at 6am one morning and there was soap all over the floor from the laundry and I almost slipped! I got back at 5pm and almost slipped a second time cause no one has come to attend to the mess. There's no upkeep whatsoever. 
The last straw was when my husband nearly fell down the staircase cause the staircase railing came off the cheap glue they used for the railing! The staircase is really very steep. The railing that came off was right at the top of the stairs, if he would've fell, he would've went straight down into the glass doors and it could very have easily been a fatal fall.

I also did not have the good fortune of seeing the owner of the budget hostel, “Tommy”,  on the property.  Despite this, I received a call from him on my personal number at 9.40pm to ask my friends and I to lower our volume, nonwithstanding that the “house rules” stated that we only had to be quiet from around 11pm onwards.  This allowed me to infer that “Tommy” acted on feedback from the other inhabitants of the hostel without ascertaining its validity. Also, the walls between the “rooms” are not solid (they have gaps at the top) and are only separated by shutter doors, which explains why sound travels easily within the property. 
You may also wish to note that following my stay, “Tommy” personally messaged me after the stay requesting that I give him a 5 star rating in return for him giving me one.

I arrived at night and she welcomed me. Git blanket and towel also. But was bad because I couldn't recharge my phones because the socket different with mine. But later from roomates i found out that i still can charge of course with different socket, so i asked to move to other bed with a socket that match my mobile phones. 
Shower was ok, but they didn't provide soap and shampoo, so i bought them at near store, and sadly quite rare to find them in small sizes in the supermarket. Supermarkets, pujasera (food market) are nearby. 
At first day they provided bread and butter but the next days I didn't see it. Coffee,tea and water always provided by them. 
WIFI was good, and lounge area also good, that's my favorite place there.

The apartment itself is very small, we are a group of 6 and the entire house is very cramp for all of us, its suitable for 2 to 3pax or maybe 4pax at most. The extra mattress provided for us were customized to fit just nice beside the bed but it's too small and short for us as well. The sofa bed is good for 2 pax, thankfully. The aircon in the bedroom is not cooling at all, the air that comes out of it is warm and not cool, it's advisable for you to bring the standing fan from the living room to the bedroom as the small fan in the bedroom is useless. There are ants in the house hence, do not leave any food or sweet stuffs lying around as it will ants within a few mins. The toilet in the bedroom have an odor but it's not that strong, you just need to spray some air freshener and it will go away. The wifi signal isn't strong, to load a YouTube video needs some time hence if you're a foreigner, it's advisable to buy your own prepaid card. Mike prepared extra towels for us but 2 of them are too small, he also provided us extra blanket and pillows which we really appreciates it. Mike allowed us to do some light cooking and all the utensils are provided, there's also a microwave oven & toaster. The wash cum dryer is a 2-in-1 function machine which make things easier for us, detergents are provided. The apartment is facing the main road which will get noisy in the evening or in the wee hours in the morning but if you're okay w it, it should be fine. Mike is very helpful, he's patience as well. I took time to reply as I needed to wait for my friends' reply, he didn't rush me for me. He was there early for our check-in but we were late and he's willing to wait for us without complaining. He even walked out of the building to find our car to guide us to the carpark which is located in a small alley. When I reported to him about ants, he was sorry about and asked us to use the insect spray but there's no help for the wifi connection. He allowed us to checkout late as and even gave me a clear instruction of what to do for self check-out. Overall for the stayca was okay, it can be improve.

7552,7552,"The good: Mike was great. Check-in was as smooth as could be. His communication is very quick as well. The location of the condo is superb. There is plenty of eating places around and the short proximity to the 3 MRT options is a huge plus. The unit itself is generally modern and clean (more on this below). I think everyone would prefer lower prices for everything they pay for, but all things considered I think the value for the price isn’t bad.
The bad: much of what the other young lady described in her review persisted for our stay. Although we only had 2 people I think this unit is far too small to accommodate any more than that comfortably. The WiFi DOES work but is pretty slow. Could be the equipment or provider. I’m not sure. That funky smell she describes is accurate as well. I think the drains need cleaned and a dissolvable drain scent stick inserted. The main contributing factor for not giving a higher rating is the cleanliness... upon check in we noticed some ants and he provided us with some ant spray as he proceeded to explain how they’re common in Singapore which I can attest is true - at least partially. We were still a little uncomfortable because most of the ants were in the kitchen area and on the wall where the cutting board are hanging. As I mentioned above, the place is generally clean and in good shape, however a couple hours after check in we happened to look up in the bathroom and there is a bunch of mold on the ceiling and walls. Although nothing came of it, my wife and I happen to be allergic to mold so this was considerably uncomfortable for us. 
I think there are a couple easy fixes that could make this place a 5 star stay and a place I would recommend to anyone needing a place to stay while in Singapore.

7571,7571,"James was a friendly host who tried to accommodate me, but unfortunately at the time of my stay, the unit could not be considered ready for a tenant.  An entire wall of the unit is windows with no curtains so you get up with the sun whether you like it or not.  There were interruptions on a regular basis for construction work inside and around the unit despite my requests for privacy.  The bed is two twin mattress put together so if you move towards the center of the bedding, you will fall through the crack and onto the floor.  It was my own fault for not realizing that Wifi was not an included amenity, but James insisted that he compensate me for that although he did not follow through.  Initially, it was a pleasure to assist in the set up of the unit such as helping fix the washer/dryer unit (transit bolts were still in place), but the enjoyment of that aspect wore off on me quickly.
Despite my gripes, the unit is a beautiful modern apartment, and the area is amazing with so many swimming pools, it seems like the towers are floating on the water.  There are meeting pods scattered through the area that are perfect to host gatherings which I did.  My party was a great success because of that, the pools, and James' assistance with arranging the booking of the meeting pod.
It is my hope that many tenants will get to enjoy this property after James has had time to have the necessary work finished in the unit.  The unit is very close to a couple bus stops which are only two stops away from the the East-West MRT line which is also right next to Eunos Hawker center.  The location is favorable for one on the Eastern side of the city.  Overall, however, I would have to say that my experience was a negative one from several interruptions of privacy, and I could not get a proper rest during my stay either due to noise, excessive sunlight, or construction crews coming into the apartment if I did not answer the door fast enough after trying to hurry to put clothes on.  For a few days during my last week there, I was sick to my stomach from some poorly chosen local food, and recovery was difficult because of those issues.

7905,7905,"I am so glad I stayed at Ong's place!  The location couldn't be better.  YOu step out of the building right into a street with a hawker center with all the delicious food you can imagine.  One of the stalls is even in the Michelin guide (not starred, but mentioned, which is still great. )  I could walk so easily all over Chinatown, and the financial center area, to the Marina Bay, and the government buildings area that I never even took a taxi or bus.  
Ong's place is in what looks like one of the oldest high rises in the area, and from the outside and on the hallways looks run down, and the inside of the apartment with it's 5 or so rooms for airBnB guests is not like the glitzy super modern rooms that so many other Singapore hosts offer.  But it's a friendly feeling inside, has 3 bathrooms with showers (one of them large) for the guests to share,  the view from the rooms is amazing day and night, and Elle seems to be cleaning around the clock.  The room also has so many amenities, from large amounts of drinking water to electrical outlets that accomodate any kind of international plug.  
I had stayed a few weeks earlier in one of the glitzy new rooms AirBnB which was fine, but felt very sterile and not cozy at all.  At Ong's place, on the other hand, I got a sense of how Singaporeans live, and from the slightly shabby building outside I had a sense of ""the old"" Singapore of 40 or so years ago.

The place is as mentioned in the listing, the place is quite clean but it is small (Its Singapore standard) Good for a single traveller or a couple if they can adjust the size. I didn't use the kitchen nor the laundry during my stay, but its handy to have a full kitchen and laundry facilities, if you want to cook or do your laundry. The room is a bit too small, you will have to jump in to the bed, as there is hardly any space to move around. Bed was good, clean sheets and a good quality quilt. TV was available, but didn't switch it on. The internet speed was great, to stream movies and watch Netflix on my laptop. Toilet, again was a bit small but clean and tidy. The towels were clean but very old and thin, I expected newer better towels. 
As mentioned by previous guests, i too had an issue with the heat in the studio. The AC is only in the bedroom and the size/capacity of the AC is not good enough to even cool the room properly. If you open the bedroom door, you can feel the heat in your face. Right outside the room windows, they have 6 AC outdoor units on one side and 3 on the other side, and they are on almost 24 hours, not only the noise but the heat it produces is too much for the small AC in the room to cool the room down. 
I did send a message to Elise about it, she was very quick in responding, she got someone to take a look while I was away and the advise was to keep the door closed and leave the AC on for sometime to cool the room down. After a few hours, the room was a bit cooler than before, but no where cold enough for a room that size with an AC.

9415,9415,"I had a nice but not perfect stay at Patro's place. Firstly the area is quite nice - residential while being close to shops, transport and facilities. I found it easy to get around by foot, bus and train. There was a nice looking pool but I didn't use it due to the weather at the time. 
The bed is very comfy and the bathroom nice and new with a good shower and big towels. 
Patro was quick to respond to any issues that arose and communication was good. 
Patro left a range of food and drinks in the apartment, which was kind (though do recommend to leave water).
Unfortunately there were a few small things that marred the stay. Firstly the list of rules and restrictions I found to be a little bit 'excessive' and overbearing, particularly to provide a passport copy to use the internet. Nevertheless, I did agree to this before I checked in. 
Patro also requested a cash charge for a late check in (9pm), which was outside this long list of rules and which I have not heard from a host before, but was kindly waived in the end. Patro was also 20m late to arrive for check in, though the taxi from the airport was quite quick.
  
When entering the house each time, there is quite a 'musty' smell, which was overwhelming when not used to it. While the bed and bathroom are very nice, I found the other features of the house such as the small kitchen, wardrobe and lounge to be quite dated and 'rickety'. A hairdryer provided broke straight away, and it was very difficult to get into the house with the key provided. 
As mentioned, while these issues were rectified really quickly, it would have just been good if they didn't occur in the first place - that's what makes a really good, smooth trip. Perhaps there may be a few more checks done before a guest checks in, but there absolutely must be an airing out of the property for it to be a comfortable stay. 
Regardless, I think Patro and her husband for the hospitality. ",0.6913324634613183,2.944503458498024,3.092750708309468,0.0901060344894733,0.037159749888983,0.999643087387085,NEGATIVE,0.1778013833992095,0.1978984180586717,0.6505119933993213,0.5917654808959157

9459,9459,"It was fine for a place to sleep for a night or two. It was my first time staying in a hostel and I’m not sure what I expected, but based on this experience I don’t think hostels are for me. The space between the beds is very narrow and cannot accommodate more than one person at a time, so it is helpful to organize yourself so you only have to go quickly in and out of your locker once or twice in the morning. 
Breakfast was coffee, tea, bread and jam/butter/Nutella, plain cornflakes and chocolate o’s with regular or low-fat milk, and orange slices. I would have preferred to pay a little less and use that money to get breakfast elsewhere. 
Offers free 2.5-hour tours of Chinatown and Little India. I wasn’t able to avail myself of the tours, but it sounded nice. 
Check-in and checkout were quick and painless. If you’re planning to check out between 7 and 7:30, maybe let them know the night before because the office is supposed to open at 7 but it’s in the same area as the dining area, so there was somebody around but they didn’t open the door until I knocked a few times. 
There is a bus stop right out front which is very convenient, MRT is not far. City Square mall is a block or two away and safe to walk. Lots of restaurants nearby and easy enough to get a Grab taxi.
The showers and bathrooms were not very clean with puddles in the toilet stalls and clumps of hair in the showers, so I would definitely recommend shower shoes. Washer and dryer available but costs $4  to wash and $4 to dry. 
Make sure to check whether your reservation is for a male, female, or mixed dorm. I didn’t realize I had booked a mixed dorm and the female dorm was full so I couldn’t switch. 
The capsule blackout curtains were very effective with sound and light, though I would suggest earplugs if you are sensitive to doors opening/closing or snoring.

9641,9641,"We had mixed experience as regards our stay at Sam’s place. The facility is good enough to provide a comfortable stay to a group of 4 persons. The amenities available at the house definitely conform to the description given in the display website. All in all, our stay was comfortable.
On the other side, as on the day we landed in the house, we had a run-in with the domestic helper who was present inside the house, when we unlocked the door. Although Sam later apologized by stating “And really sorry about the incident you all had with the house keeper"".
Sam did not meet us during her stay and chose to communicate with us at her pleasure.  It was not a compulsive social desire for us to meet with her, but there is critical legal element here. In Singapore, as per the extant laws, the guidelines issues by Urban Development Authority do not allow home-owners to sublet their premises for stays of less than six months. The only exception being the case that home owners may occasionally invite their relatives or friends from overseas to stay with them when they visit Singapore.
Please see https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/perspectives/home/short-rental.aspx 
Given the above background, during the entire course of our stay, we did not have any familiarity with Sam except having her Cell number.  While we did not face any issue, but a niggling doubt kept disturbing us, as we knew nothing about our “host” of whom we are supposed to be either “relative” or “friend”. Guests may seek National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) of the host and host is advised to provide an appropriate identity document, or may keep the same in the file containing the rules of stay.

Upon reaching the place we were informed that 'according to hotel regulations' only three of us could stay in the room and the fourth person was a guest who'd have to check out by 10. 
They were unable to make any additional arrangements for us or reach any compromise, which was understandable given it was new years. However, not only were they reluctant to give us a refund but also did not seem to have any management around to talk to? The receptionist kept telling us that all the upper management were on 'leave for the holidays,' until she eventually put one of them on call for us - who turned out to be quite unhelpful as well. No new ground was covered here.
After much haranguing we finally managed to reach a compromise - if we checked out immediately, we would be able to request a refund through Airbnb. However, the entire handling of the situation left a particularly bad taste in my mouth. It is incredibly unprofessional to not communicate vital information, not to mention the flippant and offhand way the hotel tried to dismiss our complaints is not a good look for them.

10889,10889,"Maybe for two people this place is fine. However the four of us experienced so many problems, it was extremely uncomfy to live in. 
First of all, it's much smaller than the photos show. I expected something smaller as usual, knowing how crammed apartments can be, but you walk into the apartment and straight away there's the table and once the couch is unfolded there's nowhere to store luggage except in the tiny kitchen and we had to parkour over our own suitcases to get anywhere. 
Secondly, the bed is hard but the couch is even worse. You can feel the legs and holes/gaps in the couch. I'm a person who can sleep on the floor but by the end of the trip we ended up using the additional mattresses to soften it up. 
Thirdly, the shower. We got about 4-5 visits from massive cockroaches. When you turn the water on it smells like stale/sewage water. You have to let it run a bit before it's ok. Theres no curtain so water goes everywhere which would have been ok, but the floor rug does not dry in there and neither do the towels so everything stays damp. We started hanging things outside just to dry. 
4: the Aircon is terrible. The host disclaimered this so we came prepared but you either suffer in the heat with both on or turn one off and start an ice age in one of the rooms. It's perfect to sleep in one of the rooms but not both. 
5: there's a baby constantly screaming in the corridor from about 4-5am. Not the hosts fault but something to keep in mind.
6: we had big suitcases and had to drag them up stairs because the designated shown entrance only has stairs and no elevator until you climb two floors into parking. Not a big problem but something to keep in mind. 
On the plus side there's a Peppa pig plush in case you would like to hold something for comfort. Check in easy. 
If this is your last and only choice, by all means I would say it's doable. But it's not ideal for a stay longer than a few days.",0.6903804224055855,2.6704545454545454,3.00112100374168,0.0706386731115476,0.0462498373487458,0.9999876022338868,NEGATIVE,0.0681818181818181,0.0077799206707386,0.5497781562063732,0.5222619047619048
10900,10900,"I was traveling with my husband & my 2.5 yo son. Our main purpose was to attend my friend's wedding in Shangrila hotel and to check up at Mount Elizabeth hospital, so i was searching for airbnb nearby. Tryston place was quite near(sgd12 to Shangrila by uber on peak hour, and walking distance to Mount E hospital). 
I would say this room is like Hongkong's style apartment if you've been to one,  only bigger. It is an apartment with 5 rooms&a small kitchen& washing area.
Tryston was a vey patient host & very fast response. I believe he was disappointed at us on our arrival day because we were 45 mins late. The airport was very crowdedthat day, and we were rushing with our luggages & a sleepy son therefore i forgot to inform tryston. So it kept his assistant waiting for 45 mins. I was truly sorry about that.
So, room wise, i would say that it was not very kid friendly as it didn't have water heater which would be very crucial for mom & kid. Especially during rainy day like that day. I had hard time giving bath to my son. If you are traveling without kids it might not be a problem at all. The other thing was the bed. It was too swingy in our opinion.
The best thing about this room is none other than the location. It was 10-15mins walk to somerset mrt(which is like the central of everywhere amazing) and close to restaurants, food court, bars & shopping area.

11529,11529,"I had some issues with Triston's house, and I had to report them to AirBnB. AirBnB agreed with me and gave me a full refund. Blow is the document we sent them.
Dear Sir or Madam, 
It is with great distress that I'm writing to you in regards to the quality of this Airbnb (27 Bencoolen Street). One day before we were due to check in to 10F Braddell Hill Road the house owner, Triston, told us, he will ""upgrade"" our room for free. Our new room was in the same apartment, so we checked the ""new room"" on Airbnb and saw a mountain of negative comments. 
On Saturday 30th March 2019, we contacted Airbnb to register our concerns about the mountain of negative comments on Tristan's account. Airbnb informed us that we couldn't do anything until we moved in and that our only option was to report any issues with evidence. 
We then contacted the house owner, Tristen, directly and spoke with him about another property (27 Bencoolen Street) he has advertised on Airbnb. We requested to stay at 27 Bencoolen Street as the comments were better and Tristan agreed. On Sunday 31st March 2019, we checked-in to 27 Bencoolen Street. 
Upon our arrival, we had several serious issues;
1. There is a thick layer of green mold from the ceiling to the floor in the bathroom.  
2. The apartment seems severely overcrowded. (We need to know how many occupants are allowed) 
3. There is one toilet and 9 bedrooms.
4. The overwhelming smell of sewage from the only toilet.  
5. A really bad smell from the bathroom drain ( I woke up because of this smell and left all of the windows and still can’t breathe. 02 April)
6. The general cleanliness of the apartment is lacking. 
7. We booked the room for one month, and the only provided one sheet & pillowcase. 
8. One towel for the month. 
9. They won’t clean the room during my stay(one towel each for a month)
Please refer to the photo/video evidence provided below. 
This situation is very distressing to both myself and my partner. I believe the rooms have been illegally divided to maximise Triston's profit. 
I look forward to your swift reply. 
Yours sincerely,

11811,11811,"DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND. The place is small, old, dirty and smell. No free towel. Noise. Look like no host to control everything.
Weakness: 
The bedroom is so bad. The sheet is smell and really dirty. I am afraid the host doesn't clean again all things before new guest came.
- Bathroom is so dirty. Hot/Cold machine doesn't work. Don't have free towel. You must rent  (!!!, don't think this happen).  And if you stay at weekend, maybe host doesn't there and response to you (directly or facebook message).
- Don't have special room for snore people or specific device for normal people (as some other AirBnB).  
Here is my detail situation: Host doesn't have free towel (as other AirBnB I have joined). We must rent it. Rented tower is put inside the box with locker. Outside of the box, there is the message ""Contact host with <facebook_contact> for getting locker password"". I have contacted and send voice message but no response. Really frustrated for staying at house without towels, host doesn't response.
Strong point:
- Next to Chinatown MRT (30 seconds).  But you don't really need it. Every places in Singapore can be gone with Bus/MRT. Also if you are tourist, you often go to attraction.

- there is no door or lock in the room on the loft
- the staircase to the loft is circular and very thin, making it quite risky to go up and down and that too with luggage or in the middle of the night when you want to use the restroom downstairs
- the bathroom is on a level below the loft room and shared by 2-3 others
- the bed is great for 1 person but quite small for 2
- roosters are indeed very loud and incessant
- the flooring is wooden which makes it noisy for the people downstairs. But you simply cant stop walking in your own room because of this! 
- location is not too conducive to central or major attractions. It was not possible to come in the middle of the day to rest and head back. We mostly stayed out all day as getting back home in between was just not possible

Since there is no ventilation the smell just stayed in there from the last guest. There were stains on the carpet everywhere, and when you sat on the toilet you could see vomit on the walls that was not cleaned up. i kept on hoping that at one point the cleaning lady would clean it up seeing as I had not done this at all, but it seemed like no one noticed the whole 5 days i stayed there. They cleaned my room twice out of the whole time, and out of all the showers I never received even lukewarm water. it was always ice cold. I spent most of my time out of the room because without a window and the amenities being so bad i just decided it was worth it to just use it as a sleeping place.

The room is clean, I felt comfortable walking bare feet in the room, but the bedroom is right next to a dark and damp water area, the aircon air smelt like a sewer the whole time.
Washing machine & dryer room was locked so we couldn’t use it which was a big let down.
There are many other rooms there and the first 3 days were good, but the other 2 days, it was noisy and one night a group of people came back at 2am, making so much noise. Another time, a group of peopl didn’t respect the rules and blasted music & sang along with it for an hour, talked loudly and had social gathering at the common area after 2:30am-3:30am, however, nothing had been done.
Location is good, 5 min walk to Ferrer Station and 10 min walk to the 24hr mall.
No lift, so you need to go up 3 flight of stairs which would be a struggle for ladies with a big luggage.
There’s a cafe under the building and the staffs there don’t seem to like the Airbnb guests and would give you dirty stares, which may make ppl uncomfortable.
Safety wise, there’re big windows missing at the common area and it’s only 1/F, so if someone wanted to break in to the place, it’s very easily done.
Communication was fast & easy with Nanda.

Good:
1) Front Desk allowed Early Check In.
2) Front Desk staff helped with carrying bags to 4th floor room.
3) Front Desk helped with updating guest name to my son's when airbnb itself didn't.
4) Room was clean.
Bad:
1) The room was different from shown in pictures. We had booked this room specifically because the pictures showed a chest of drawers and a wardrobe in the room. The actual room  had neither.
2) The room was on 4th floor in a building that has no elevator. This wasn't disclosed in the description.

15328,15328,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. We stayed at Tryston's place for 3 months so I believe we have a good overview of what to expect. Let's start with the good. The GOOD is the location and price. It's located right downtown within 10 minutes by foot to many eateries and shopping. Also, it is on a very quiet street. The price is very affordable compared to other rooms in Singapore. The host Tryston is usually not around so you have your private space and he is easily reachable by message. The BAD is that it's extremely dirty and it's an old place. There were problems with the electricity turning off and the water pipes coming loose. The room looked like it wasn't cleaned before we arrived with dirt, dust and mold everywhere. The provided linens also had stains on it and one pillow had black mold all over it. Usually we don't mind cleaning but because it was very dirty we had to hire a professional cleaner which costed us $100. We also had to buy our own bed sheets, cover, pillow case and towels. The bed is also located close to the steep stairs so we had to rearrange & move the bed to a more safe place. There were also many ants which I eventually took care of by covering many small holes in the walls with matching color tape. The kitchen is shared by 9 rooms(According to Tryston's assistant) so it's often dirty with the trash overflowing & rotten food in the sink. You will also regularly see big cockroaches. While Tryston does come clean it about once a week(?) it's not nearly enough to keep it clean often. The UGLY is that Tryston wrote us this message right after we booked & payed for the room, ""Oh I forgot to inform u that utilities is payable monthly at 100$"". After I messaged him we won't be paying an additional $100 he went silent for half a week and I had to write Airbnb to mediate the situation. 1 week into our stay he knocked on our door and said some people were on their way to see the room. He was pushy and didn't give us much choice but to say OK as they were already on their way. 2 weeks into our stay a water pipe outside our room came loose and water was spraying all over the kitchen floor. This water pipe connects the water heater that is outside our room to our shower. This pipe runs along side of the stairs & can get very hot. We burned ourselves a few times while climbing the stairs. When this pipe came loose I heard the water spraying outside our door and went to check. I took a picture & sent it to Tryston which he came to fix it within a hour. After he fixed it he accused us of pulling the pipe when we climb the stairs.

15443,15443,"We stayed in Alee's house for 3 days. The stay was moderately comfortable, let me provide brief overview of the accommodation:
Pros:
- The house is near many eateries which are open 24 hours. So, several of food options are available.
- The house is near a FairPrice shop, so one can purchase grocery, fruit,stationary etc at ease.
- The room and toilet were clean. The AC was working properly.
Cons:
-  Depending on walking speed, the house is 11-15  minutes away from Eunos MRT and NOT 7 minutes as claimed by the host.
- The kitchen is shared between 6 rooms and very untidy. Neither there was any soap nor any scrubber in the sink. The kitchen tops were greasy. No cloth/mop was provided for cleaning the dining table and the table was greasy. As a whole, the kitchen is very dirty.
- The room lock is defective. One has to try several times before the lock opens. It's a matter of serious concern. I felt tensed when the lock was not opening in the dead of night.
- It takes roughly 40 minutes by train to reach the CBD. So, if someone is short of time and wants to cover most Singapore attraction, this place is not suitable.
- The house, in our view, is not value for money. We have stayed in many Airbnb houses before and giving this opinion based on our experience.
The house is okay for a day or night stay, but we do not recommend this house for anyone who wants to stay for more than 2 days.

15570,15570,"Hello All,
Generally, the place is clean and the hosts are very particular about house rules such as no wearing of shoes in house and usage of facilities.
Alee's place is located 1 kilometre away from the nearest Train Station, so if you catch a train, prepare for a long walk. We mostly opted to travel in bus due to this.
There are variety of stores and restaurants around which was good.
The hosts do not supply any bottled water nor bathing soap, so please bring those stuff with you including Detergent if you wish to wash your clothes. The washing machine is provided and so is the hangers. The bathroom and toilets are shared with others. So at times you need to wait for your turn.
The room was aircon and had tv and fan. There was no milk or sugar for tea making though.
The room is located close to a street where big trucks pass through including noise making motorcycles, so it does become a nuisance at times. Even cats and squirrels run around on the roofs so a bit of disturbance there. The bed seemed broken as if was making noises everytime you turn.
The hosts valued our privacy which was good.
When it was time to go, the host was very impatient and made us feel unwelcomed. So much for super host! We were asleep around 8am when you could hear the host shouting at other guests for something (disturbing our sleep) and also cleaning the washroom by making way to much noise such as banging the bucket.
I only saw and met Alee on my final day. She even sat infront of the room from 9am and waited for us to leave. We left around 9.30am and felt as if we are being chased or something. Bad experience there.
For what its worth, its good to stay for a night or so. But do not expect much kindness from hosts. The other guests were more kindly and engaged in conversation with us.

16221,16221,"The front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful. The unit is quite nice, generally well-constructed, with a good layout and spacious enough for our family (two adults, two young kids) to stay comfortably for 6 nights. But our stay got off to a very bad start. We had selected this unit over others as the Airbnb largely due to the bed configuration. Airbnb shows the following details: 2 bedrooms - correct 3 beds – wrong, there are only two beds Bedroom 1: 1 king bed – wrong, it’s one queen bed Bedroom 2: 2 double beds – wrong, its one queen bed The actual two beds rather than the listed three beds was a problem for us. It might have been OK if one bed was really a king size bed as listed, but that wasn't so. When we checked in and found airbnb’s listing info to be incorrect on several details, the staff told us it was airbnb’s fault and that the entire building had no units with the details listed in Airbnb – not good news to hear when checking in. So we had to ask for an extra floor mattress, to which the staff informed me there might be an extra charge. Imagine my chagrin at being warned there might be an extra charge, as, in my mind, we should get a partial refund from Airbnb for an inflated listing that over-stated the number of beds and the size of the bed in the master bedroom. My son had to sleep on the floor instead of the listed third bed. We chose this place and paid more than other listings precisely for the listed bed configuration, which was all incorrect. The Airbnb listing also states “2.5 bathrooms”. Wrong. There are two bathrooms, although this was totally adequate and not an issue. But it further shows the inaccuracies and inflated specs in this listing. Additionally, on our first night, the wifi didn’t work. My wife and I manage an IT business and manage dozens of IT professionals. We are quite proficient in troubleshooting wifi issues. We could not find a signal for our unit. I did all the standard troubleshooting actions such as turning off and restarting the router, checking all incoming cables, etc. Nothing worked. When I spoke with front desk staff they just recommended connecting to any other unit’s signal – which hardly worked as I only got one bar and the signal would cut out often. The staff told me to enter the password and then I would see our unit’s network signal. Of course, you can’t enter a password without specifying a network name. Even another guest who overheard this nonsensical recommendation laughed in commiseration with me. So I spent several hours our first night, not with my wife and kids, but, rather, performing technical service for our host. I told them there was a fundamental problem with the router. To their credit, they had a technician come in the next day and they replaced the broken router, i.e., their technician confirmed my diagnosis. After the router replacement, the wifi worked well, and I typically got download speeds of 25Mbps. I wonder: had no other guest mentioned the lack of wifi in this unit? Did the router coincidentally die just before our arrival? I realized late in our stay that I had never entered a password, but was able to connect to the wifi automatically. It then dawned upon me that there was no security and the wifi was totally open and non-secure. Had I thought about this earlier, I would have used my VPN connection, but I didn’t. My bad. I started to get bombarded by scam / phishing emails to all my email accounts. I had to change all my passwords upon my return home. Advice to Thanksgivings: set up each unit’s wifi to require a password, as well as using other security settings. I was surprised that the unit didn’t have cable TV channels or an Internet-enabled TV. It just has 6 basic local channels, several of which aren’t in English. This made the TV pretty useless, especially for our kids. I consider cable TV with dozens of channels to be a standard amenity for the price paid for this unit, and as we've had in other Singapore airbnb units. All furniture, closets, and appliances are good, including a safe. The washing machine works well and spin dries clothes to about 90% dry, after which they can be hung on the drying rack. There are also an iron and ironing board. The induction stove works very well, but only has one burner, which really limits its utility, especially for a family of four. They should have spent an extra $100 to get a two-burner stove. The water pressure is excellent, and the water is very hot – until it runs out after 10 minutes. We followed the staff’s directions about turning on the hot water switch 5 – 15 minutes ahead of time, but, still, hot water usually ran out after about 10 minutes. Not ideal for a family of four. The master bathroom has a full door. The second bathroom has a half door, and I could not find a way to prevent shower water from going over the entire bathroom floor. The host could buy a plastic shower curtain on a tension rod for $10. There are no mirrors in the unit outside the bathrooms. The sink in the second bathroom was clogged from when we arrived, and I pulled much women’s hair out of it, as well as finding much women’s hair in the bathroom generally upon our arrival. Our first 24 hours, we were able to get taxis two times within 1 minute just by waiting on the corner. But for the rest of our stay, that failed, and we had to always book taxis via the front desk. It costs $3 extra, but better than having the family bake in the sun and heat...",0.6904581177503037,2.615098566308244,2.9666902423682275,0.0530645752307465,0.0709649635506152,0.9999594688415528,NEGATIVE,0.0460394265232975,-0.0101072771900263,0.4794187370807073,0.4478494623655915

The apartment is perfectly located, you are pretty close to China Town as well as many restaurants, bars, coffee houses etc. Also you can walk around 45 minutes and get to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There are also buses stations, right around corner.
If you are a fan of Friends TV show, I recommend you to visit, only licensed (out of the US) coffee house, which looks almost the same as in the TV show - it is around 15 minutes walk from the apartment.
The apartment is on a top (4th) floor (there is no elevator so you will need to carry your luggages).
The biggest issue that we have experienced, was very loud air-condition from the neighbours. We inform the host, but it got fixed for only one night. I understand that there is nothing much to do to fix it but it caused us trouble with our sleep.
The host let us to go to the apartment, before check-in and also we could leave our luggages with Nympha after our check-out (since we had a late night flight). She was very responsive on WhatsApp.

The rooftop terrace has a nice open kitchen and shower. Lk’s assistant, which stays one floor below, is usually very responsive. The cons were: the building itself is next to SG’s largest inter-city express-highway, i.e. the ambient noise level (almost 24/7) is not insignificant. In case you turn on the aircon, it adds to the noise level, because they are located on the rooftop terrace, hence don’t expect a quiet environment, in case you are the type who likes to enjoy the terrace. Given that the room is just under the roof, it gets very quickly pretty stuffy and humid, not too pleasant. In case your room is booked for the next day, don’t take it as granted to leave your luggage, in case you have to bridge a few hrs, because there isn’t any or much storage capacity.

The sofa which was not the one advertised, felt like sitting on rocks - there were no cushions.

17138,17138,"The apartment was great, although quite small, it was modern, well equipped as advertised, and spotless clean. Great location and the building facilities were very nice. Communication with Rajan (owner) were great. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it. 
The only issue was with the check in and I think it's important that future visitors are aware of what I experienced and make sure in advance with Rajan that he has addressed these issues with the company he uses to manage the apartment (that's what he told me he will do). 
The check in process was extremely cumbersome, apparently due to the fact that Rajan hired a local company to manage the process. Other than communicating with Rajan (who was fine), I was then contacted by a total of 3 different people sequentially to schedule the check in. Each one handed me off to the next one, not sure why only the actual person who met me couldn't contact me. 
The actual check in person arrived with a lengthy inventory list which I was asked to sign, as if I were going to count the spoons. Whatever. Then the guy asked me for a $500 cash deposit! He even has this pre-printed deposit receipt ready, as if this was a normal  standard request.  This is where they crossed the line and I told him this would be reported to Airbnb immediately. He called his ""office"" and then backed down from the request. Very unorthodox. 
They also left me with one key even though this was a 2-bedroom apartment and I was there with a colleague. Again at first when I asked for a second key he said I would need to give a $250 cash deposit. When I again  I'd complain to Airbnb he said he's check with the office and ended up providing me with the key ""free of charge"".

Our flatmates were often awake until 1/2am and were noisy.  We were told that we would have to move out of the flat in a month if we were not willing to pay more rent and if we did pay, we could do so under the table without AirBnb. In addition, the family brought durians into the flat several times and stored them in the fridge, so our food take on this smelly odour, making them inedible.

17146,17146,"Communication with Jiayi about the apartment we had booked before arriving in Singapore was very good. However, two weeks before we left Canada, she emailed us to say that she recommended we stay in this shophouse apartment apartment due to concerns about the management in the original apartment we had booked. We appreciated receiving that information.  She wanted an additional $50 CDN for the shophouse  apartment and (the apartment owner) would not consider renting at the same price. She did offer a smaller apartment without the full facilities that we wanted. Although we agreed to the change and paid the difference, we thought this was not the best business approach.
The shophouse apartment is spacious enough but appears, by North American standards,  to be for a single occupant. There is room to hang clothing, and there are shelves and drawers. The living room area is large and has good air-conditioning. However, the kitchen table is only a 2-foot round and is barely large enough for two people to eat. There is one piece of art on a wall in the living room and another in the bedroom. We suggest that the owner add some cheap posters or pictures to brighten up the place.
Our host kindly provided cornflakes, white bread, jam, butter, whole milk, and eggs as well as a package of facial tissues. We purchased our own healthier skim milk and cereal.
There is a good-sized safe in one of the cupboards. There is an electrical plug adaptor but you will need a two prong adaptor to fit into it. There is a DVD player with several DVDs.
The small table lamp on the left side of the queen bed has an intermittent electrical connection.
As may sometimes be the case in this hot country, the cooking stove and bathroom/shower are actually outside the apartment. This smaller area is very hot all day and all night. We could also hear the neighbours’ vehicles and activities from this open area, sometimes during the night and on the weekends.
The air conditioning in the bedroom area is very good.
There were some minor issues with cleanliness (dusty shelves, dirty areas in the kitchen) and insufficient towels for two people; but our host was very quick to respond. She also offered to have the whole apartment cleaned and sheets laundered for our longer stay but we declined. Two of the pillowcases and a bed sheet appeared to be stained with blood. The gas  stovetop is stained and the lid for the large garbage can in the kitchen area is also old and stained. The upper pipes in the shower are coated with green corrosion. The ceiling above the shower is starting to peel.
Unlike other Airbnbs we have stayed in, the owner did not provide a binder of information about this location,  which usually has suggestions for restaurants, a subway map, and brochures for restaurants and tourist sites. We would recommend that this be provided in the future. The owner could also provide clear, written instructions on how to turn on the hot water, and how to operate the television as we had problems in both areas. It would also be simple enough for her to provide specific instructions to guests for accessing the MRT subway at the airport and taking it to the Little India MRT station.
Perhaps indicative of this aging apartment was the incident in which the old coffee maker short-circuited, blowing out the main circuit breaker which is located elsewhere  in the building. This means that not only the air conditioning, but also the Wi-Fi were out. We were very concerned because we do not have cell phone coverage outside of our home country. We were therefore unable to contact our host. Fortunately, she was in the building at that very time and was able to reset the main circuit breaker.
This apartment  is only a two-minute walk from the Little  India MRT (subway) station which has two subway lines accessible. It is a convenient,  clean and interesting area to stay. There are three Hindu temples within a half hour walk including a major one, as well as a very large shopping centre within a half hour walk and a hawker food centre within a ten minute walk.

We couldn't use the numerous pools in the complex, there was no time for that. For those who don't care about a day more or less, I can only warmly recommend to plan a day for the pools.
The host kindly picked us up at the airport and even borrowed us money for the EZ-Link cards, as they only accepted cash. Then we took a taxi to our accommodation (costs approx. 20 SGD). The apartment is fully equipped, including three air conditioners. Benny quickly explained everything relevant to us and that was it. He always answered questions quickly. Unlimited internet is available. Unfortunately a supermarket is missing in the direct environment, which is somewhat further away. There is a mini market in the 7/11-style on the area. The MRT station is right around the corner, so the distance to the city centre is no problem. 
You really can't complain here. Only a few minimal remarks, maybe it is relevant for someone (or a tip for Benny):
- Unfortunately there are hardly any TV channels available. Most of them are encoded.

1. Location: Short walk from Aljuneid MRT, with plenty of options around for food
2. Cleanliness: Decent cleanliness level of toilets / showers (also enough number of showers, so no need to queue for turn to shower like in some hostels)
3. Layout: Common, green area was nice, cute touch (instagrammable for those inclined)
Con's:-
1. Red light: Slightly unsettling with the red light activity right outside (i.e. large groups of men looking after groups of women in skimpy clothing looking for patrons)
2. Room: Room door allows too much light from corridor in; tough to fall asleep without a proper eye mask / sleeping on your side.
3. Cleanliness: Blankets felt a little itchy. Might be isolated issue.
To further elaborate on the red light activity - they will give you some unsettling looks but are largely harmless if you just don't make eye contact and walk straight into the accom. I imagine it might be more uncomfortable for women, especially at night.

17910,17910,"Everyone we interacted with at Heritage Apartments was friendly and professional, but it is super frustrating that their listings are not accurate representations of where you will actually stay. It seems like their policy is to let guests book any listing on Airbnb, regardless of if it is actually available, and then they ultimately place you in any ""similar"" unit that they have unoccupied in the neighborhood. So for anyone who pays attention when you book, don't expect to get an apartment with the same layout as listed. The units are clean and new, but not particularly thought out in the way that an airbnb with an independent host often is - they lack some thoughtful features such as switches near the bed or a dresser in the bedroom. The sloped ceiling upstairs means we whacked out heads often and there wasn't enough light to see inside our suitcases at night when we arrived (they were kind enough to provide a desk lamp the next day). There is no outlet in the bathroom or anywhere that you can use an appliance near a mirror. Laundry detergent was provided which was nice. The windows do a good job of keeping the busy street noise out, but there are only blackout curtains, no sheers, and since they face the street and are in front of the bathroom you pretty much have to keep them closed unless you plan to get dressed immediately after showering and before leaving the bathroom.

This was the dirtiest air bnb we had ever checked into. 
Additionally, we arrived late in the evening and the cot for my child was completely unsafe- the mattress was too big for the cot, making it slope which is completely unsafe for any child. There was also not a clothes dryer on site as promised in the description.
However, the host did rectify these challenges. They were extremely responsive for the rest of the stay. They apartment was cleaned thoroughly, a brand new cot was purchased for my son, mattress toppers for very uncomfortable beds and
kitchen necessities were purchased  as
well as regular cleaners were facilitated. I did appreciate these efforts but expected more from a super host at check in. Especially because I had communicated I was pregnant and bringing home a newborn during my stay in advance of my checkin.

When I first got the actual contract, I was so surprised to see that the location of the house is totally different from what it said in the website. It said it was 8min walk from Botanic garden but it actually took 1hr walk. Even if when he realized that he made a mistake about the location pt, he just told me that there is no way that he can refund the money back to me, so just take 300 Singapore dollars (somehow he estimated himself as a the transportation fee) back and live in the house. I was so angry about  his attitude, however, I just gave up and decided to travel more because I was just a student came Singapore to study, so I 
did not want to make more deal with it.
Unfortunately, the trouble in this airbnb did not stopped there. When I was half way through the lease (I had a month lease) , the home owner literally just called me with his mad voice saying that I need to LEAVE the house by the next morning because the host did not paid him and is not answering his call. I thought I was caught in some kind of fraud and called Rajan but he only said that he can deal with it just do not worry about it. However for that entire day I had to be tortured by the homeowner asking for the update. I even had to get out in the middle of the class to pick up the phone, not to be kicked out of this house. At that night Rajan texted me that whether I can pay the homeowner another 3k instead of him. That moment, I just wanted to say that let me kicked out of this house and get the rest of the money back. I just do not understand the fact that why did he asked  me to take the responsibility for the job that host gets paid for.

The best thing about this apartment is the location; it is on top of Outram MRT and in Chinatown. The pool access is on the same level which is very convenient.

My biggest issue was with the A/C— it’s directed right over the bed. It had a slightly musty smell at times, and it was directed right over the bed, so if you sleep with it on, you’re getting A/C air directly on you.

( the pay for extra people is okay as I already planned for that) however the bathroom smell bad when we check in even after the cleaner cleaned it.
The cleaner said she will bring an extra bedsheet, pillow and blanket for Us but it was never come. 
Three member of my family slept on the floor. One other slept on a single dirty look mattress cos no bedsheet cover. Luckily that we have spare travel blankets. But its all fine for Us as we all just out for whole day and only need a simple place to sleep.
The most hurt and sad thing is she literally gave Us very limit time to find a new place for 1,5 days left in Singapore. My nanny is 65 and My daughter is 2 years old we also have a lot more stuff from shopping plus our luggages. So the urgent move really stress Us out especially for my Aunty family who first time ever come to Singapore. This completely ruined our whole trip and the impression about Singapore.

She told Airbnb case staff that her place was booked on the day I want and I didnt confirm her. 
Thats a lie! I checked few times after this and even on the day We moved she still has the similar or maybe even exactly the same one available.

I have booked through Airbnb for one night. Upon checking in at the reception, realised that particular room booking is for female only. Tried contact host +65 91014316, to see if there’s any other way to do a swap or a partial refund. That night the mixed room is totally full and i have no choice but to rebook other hotel, having stuck with all these for 4-5hrs, cannot do anything. 
Airbnb customer service were helpful and believe that I should at least get a partial refund from the host. Till now i have just wasted this booking without any refund and stay in the hotel. The Airbnb customer service manager then follow up very closely and had made a decision on his part to refund me 50% of my paid room. I really appreciate his help and decision!
Please be advised not to book from Airbnb. You can try booking.com or Agoda web, this is more secured if you need any help, rather than turning to Airbnb Host whereby not a single message and/or call despite “Read my messages”.

19318,19318,"I stayed here for 10 days while visiting my in-laws in Singapore. I will point out a few things starting with the pros.
PROS
* Room is super clean
* Bathroom is a decent size with free liquid soap & hot water
* Bed is comfortable
* Room itself is a decent size
* Wifi speed is decent
* Staff are very friendly
* Less than 10 mins walk to Fort Canning MRT
* Supermarket is about 7 mins walk (Although the walk back is up hill)
* There is a dedicated working area which has wifi and a view of the pool
CONS
* If you are an international travelled there will be an addition $100 fee on arrival
* There is no toaster which would be convenient as Breakfast places are not close by
* Could do with better cooking utensils. I only cooked once and the fry pan was terrible
* Very pricey for what you get
* The surrounding are more of a residential area but you get to eating places in 10mins walk
Overall I think it is overpriced however it is located in a prestigious area which is why it is expensive. I booked this place to be close to the Orchard Strip but it was a 25 min walk up hill to get back which is very difficult to do in Singapore weather. I ended up using Grab ride sharing to get to places which defeated the purpose of being close to Orchard.

The experience was further dampened by the overwhelming scent of durian fruit permeating from nearby stalls in Chinatown. This sensory assault led me to question my accommodation choice. While suitable for a short overnight stay, the hotel proved inadequate for an extended visit.
The bathroom setup, reminiscent of a scene from the ""You"" Netflix series, proved impractical. The supposed privacy offered by transparent glass enclosure was quickly dispelled by an ill-fitting door and the absence of a secure lock.

19831,19831,"This is  a decent unit in a convenient location. It was not quite what we expected because the listing said ""luxurious, new..."" It is not a new unit, so they must mean it is a new listing. This unit is not close to new. It also is not luxurious. It is a decent place to stay. There was a significant discount, so it was a good value for the two of us. A housekeeper cleans the unit several times per week and changes the bedding and towels about every four or five days. We stayed for a month, so this was great. The host is extremely responsive. It was usually only a matter of minutes before receiving a response. One night, we returned to the unit late (around midnight) to find the internet and TV were out. I sent a note to the host, expecting a response in the morning. Instead, I received a call within minutes and the issue was resolved in less than one hour. The MRT station is literally less than a five minute walk away (for perspective on that time, we are 64 years old). One of the entrances to Little India station is a few blocks farther away, but still easy walking distance. The neighborhood is a gathering place for construction workers, especially on Sunday, but we were not bothered by the crowds. We often returned to the unit between 2300 and 0000 and were very comfortable walking from either MRT station to the unit. The City Square Mall is a short walk away (you can reach it by walking through the MRT station) and there are tons of small shops within one block. The lowest level of the building is occupied by a small shop with a very friendly owner from Bangladesh. He often had Bangladesh mangoes for sale, which are like eating sweet candy, even when green. There is a safe in the unit, but it is not bolted to anything, so we didn't use it. Since this is Singapore, we really did not have any concerns with leaving our belongings in the unit. Overall, the cleaning service was a major plus that canceled out our disappointment that it was not a new unit. We would stay again if the price is right. If there is no discount, there are units with a similar price that appear to be nicer and have more amenities, like a pool.

19935,19935,"TS was a great host and the place is nicer than the photos show. The building was very secure and clean, a strange mix of small business/office spaces and converted apartments. TS's place is on the 'business' side of the floor, with no one in the spaces on either side of the flat. The other two spaces on our side of the building were not noisy businesses at all and did not disturb us in any way. The other side of the building is clearly all residences. The shower got nice and hot, with excellent water pressure, the washing machine was very good, as was the AC and the mattress. The location is near a variety of food options and very near an MRT station and a couple of supermarkets for snacks/toiletries if needed.
My only issue is with AirBnB, not TS's place. I did not realize that short-term leasing (less than 3 or 6 months) is illegal in Singapore. There may be some exceptions by building type or otherwise, but I'm no lawyer. I assumed it was like South Korea, or Japan, which have licensing and my quick research turned up that it was okay to stay in Singapore. As far as I can tell from more careful research, it is a $15,000 USD fine to the host, but currently no enforced penalty for guests. I have no idea why anyone would risk this penalty. Since it is becoming clear that AirBnB is not taking any responsibility in ensuring local legal compliance, my feelings about using AirBnB in Singapore are entirely my fault for not checking more carefully. TS was very upfront about the whole thing and the flat is very nice. If you are okay with the general situation and comfortable with the risks, I think this place is a good choice to stay. I have had to navigate a few sketchy interactions in Asia and this stay was nothing like those experiences.
I am not comfortable lying to neighbors or immigration (although no one asked us any questions, including security at the building entrance) but I also would not want to cause someone that level of fine. It does not seem that the building is the type of complex that bans short term stays (like some condo associations in larger cities), but it's a small building and I can see that neighbors might have concerns about random strangers coming and going. For this reason, I would have chosen a different type of stay in Singapore for my own peace of mind. If AirBnB were legal, I would recommend this host and stay 110%.",1.2928779928790544,2.9415032679738564,3.109572993554276,0.1215236610919995,0.0676714044498297,0.8431417942047119,NEGATIVE,0.1766013071895424,0.189866786709876,0.7155668392200755,0.5419281045751634

20905,20905,"My husband and I were in Singapore for a two week stay to visit our daughter and new granddaughter. We had an unfortunate experience with a previous host who canceled surreptitiously so we were very grateful to find this Airbnb that was reasonably priced and in a convenient location for our visit. 
One of our favorite things about the unit we stayed in was the bed. Super comfy with nice, high quality bedding. We also liked the fact that it overlooked the pool and was fairly quiet at all hours (although we didn’t spend much time there). The staff that we met were very pleasant and eager to please, and communications with the hosts via WhatsApp was efficient and timely.
But the unit was not without its issues. On our first night after getting there at around ten our key card didn’t work. We contacted management and they sent someone to replace the pad. It was nearly midnight when we got access and after an eighteen hour flight from NY we were exhausted but frankly I was impressed they were able to get someone to come at that time. 
Upon arriving, I was disappointed to find just two towels that would presumably last a week for two people. I requested two more and they quickly brought them, but they never adequately dried between uses. We tried to dry them using the dryer in the unit but it wasn’t working. Management was informed and they said it would be checked but it never got fixed. We also found it a bit odd no wash clothes were provided. Perhaps that’s a Singapore ‘thing’ but how are guests supposed to wash themselves? The bathroom could use an update, as there were cracked tiles and obvious mold. The St. Novena internet never worked, but we were able to use The Forest by Wang, which apparently was what the previous owners provided.  Also, the stovetop was tricky for us ‘westerners’ and does not come with instructions, but again, communication was swift and helpful.
When I stay in an Airbnb I always try to find a place that has a separate sitting area. This unit has that, but it was very poorly planned. The sofa was extremely uncomfortable, with no arms, very shallow and quite small. The desk in the room is too big for the space and could be eliminated entirely. So while I like to watch tv or surf the web on a sofa in a perfect world, I ended up doing everything on the bed. Speaking of tv, there were very few offerings of anything worthwhile to watch. On the plus side, there was adequate closet space for two people, the air con worked well, and the small terrace was a nice touch.

20909,20909,"I was staying here as I was a student at NTU. very in depth review incoming.
PROS: > the place is very clean and quiet.
> the facilities at the complex are very useful eg they have a gym and laundry room
> the people are friendly and he and the cleaner are always offering something to eat.
> the location is very convenient - 8-minute walk to local shopping centre, 35 minute walk to NTU campus, 10 minute bus to boon lay (MRT and big shopping centre). 
CONS: > the wifi in the room was horrible, would always cut out and towards the end of my stay i was running on data as the only place it would work was actually in the living room.
> the shower water is not very hot. halfway through the shower it would get cold. i actually moved into NTU dorms later on and the shower was much hotter.
> on weekends it was quite noisy outside because the room is opposite to the pool. i got sick because of the stuffy room, so i had to keep the window open, but then i would get woken up on weekend mornings by the kids in the pool. 
> the plug is all the way on the opposite end of the bed. if i didnt have my portable charger with me to sleep, i couldnt charge my device. i could only charge two appliances at a time. 
> the washing machine is straight-up wack. my clothes never got washed properly. it tore one of my clothes and simple marks such as ketchup or pen got turned into stains because the machine didnt wash it out. it created so much pellet and lint on tshirts. it also leaked so after every wash I had to mop up. there was a little bit of difference after i bought powder soap bc they only have liquid soap but i still had to prewash my clothes (ESPECIALLY socks). after i moved onto NTU dorm, the difference in the washing was crazy. 
> there was hardly any space in fridge for my items, i understand that im the guest and of course their items come first but i had to squish my things or move things around constantly. there is also no space to dry clothes on the rack outside, so i had to put a rack in my room and that contributed to the room getting stuffy and me getting sick. it was especially hard to dry the bedsheets. i didnt think it was right to ask them to move all their clothes so i just dealt with it. 
""so why didnt i use the washer and dryer?"" - the washer is 4 dollars, and the dryer is 3 dollars (if you want to get the clothes fully dry). i didnt want to spend 7 dollars on washing every other week. 
> i didnt know the people i would be staying with would be much older than me. at some times, it made me feel uncomfortable. for context im a 21 yo female student. when i asked before i booked hon didnt give me much details so i wish there was more transparency, though i supposed i couldve asked for more details.
> the bathroom was weird. smelt like sewer and you had to flush multiple times but NTU also had the same problem every time i turned on the shower so might be a region thing. there was also NO space to put anything (eg shampoo, soap etc) so u kind of just have to put everything on the (shower) floor?
CONCLUSION: this is 3 month minimum booking. you're paying SGD$1500 per month. its more expensive than a lot of other flats around. its a fine room and the location is okay, but if you're a student like me, especially going to NTU, i dont think its value for money. i took it because i wanted a private room, but there is actually only a few hours of alone time in the flat. if you were offered a double like me, just take the double and you can swap for a single later on. you will save SO much money and you will be SO much more comfortable.",0.6917245320199105,2.5256007197028323,2.9678916217632496,0.042722404941491,0.0369321098471289,0.9995013475418092,NEGATIVE,0.0102402878811329,0.0189464781388004,0.4441550090209037,0.4690414280555125

21181,21181,"I had, for some still hitherto irreconcilable reasons, one of if not the worst homestay experiences in my life with host Pav and his wife Joyce out of all genres or types of homestays imaginable from rental, co-living, dormitory, hotel etc.
Pav and his wife somehow colluded together to threaten me for loss of business/money/income due to a pet allergy which disallowed me from staying in his home the moment I entered the doorstep for the first time! 
First of all, I had never been received in all my life by any person from any walk of life in such a morally and ethically flagrant and revolting manner when presenting with a condition with pet hypersensitivity ( worse than allergy!!!). I could presenting to any stranger on the street, a taxi driver, an acquaintance, mum, dad, family, relatives you name it, and I have never been so woefully shamed and castigated for a medical condition I didn't and couldn't choose to have. I believe according to UN human rights charter law for Rights of Persons with Disabilities/illnesses, of which Pav the host a lawyer is surely cognizant of, the shocking treatment from Pav and his wife Joyce at my notice of pet allergy and inability to continue the stay in his home VIOLATES UN CHARTER ON RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES!!!!!
Airbnb being a free-thinking, fair, just and equitable organization who upholds the law on the rights of all human beings including those persons with disabilities/illnesses and strives to attain the standards of morality and ethics in the UN convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities/Illnesses should be treating me equally and fairly based on my individual circumstances (my medical disability/hypersensitivity) and not censure Pav and his wife Joyce for flagrant omission of justice!
The other most revolting behavior of Pav and Joyce is that I found them very dishonest changing their listing details on pets at only the moment after I told them I wanted to cancel my stay due to the presence of pet in their house!!!!!!! Of course they weren't trying to ensure they cover for their mistakes and not allow Airbnb to find out that their original listing didn't mention pets and was hence inaccurate. I was pretty sure I was obsessing over Pav's listing the week before I booked his house and am confident that no such information on pets was ever provided on it. Pav had also spoken to me on the phone on the day I checked into his house with zero indication that he himself made an accurate listing of pets. He rather scoffed at me rudely on the phone and believed me to be lying about my pet allergy when in fact the mother of all truth was that I didn't merely have a pet allergy, I rather had a pet hypersensitivity which is infinitely worst than a pet allergy!!!!! Telling him I had medical documents to prove these things didn't appease him at all, instead, he believed me more than ever a swindler and I was left ruing what nightmarish host Airbnb allows on their platform?!!!!
Pav's wife Joyce later kicked me out of the house into the rain and threw out all my boxes containing my belongings right smack in the middle of the downpour. This had the effect of damaging almost all of my belongings and dirtying them. One electronic item worth 400 dollars got so wet from the rain it just spoiled all thanks to Joyce......
I don't know why I was selected to go through this nightmare with Pav and Joyce but it does really seem like I would also never recommend anybody come stay at this horrid property ever again. I don't really know how there are even a few good reviews from previous guests at Pav's home?!!!! I would be thinking in the right frame of mind now whether those reviews were fake ones?!!!",0.6903665961844107,2.5182739072453058,2.991748934621579,0.0520016655045643,0.0888447255126372,0.999992609024048,NEGATIVE,0.0073095628981224,-0.1873399679688693,0.741506550159269,0.4811062520246194

21203,21203,The place was Very small and the kitchen was outside upstairs very strange. The response to all the issues with the room was good but the issues really were too much and not solved at the time hence we lost a lot of sleep. We had very noisy people in the room near us until 2am + the next night sleep was lost due to an aircon vent being redirected through our rooms vents the next day we moved to another room and all was perfect until our cool room turned into a hot house due to another guest turning a switch off in THEIR ROOM. It was solved within an hour but when the guests returned at 22 mins passed midnight they switched it off again so we cooked again with no sleep again until it was sorted ....we were glad to get out of there to get some sleep which I  believe the point of airbnb to to allow guests to SLEEP,0.6923516769896603,2.946875,3.068223925932492,0.0546244276772716,0.1017890165071959,0.9992747902870178,NEGATIVE,0.17875,-0.0253060725545184,0.8435865558155324,0.4196875

The walls between rooms are hollow so you can hear everything in the rooms next to you and people in my hallway were quite loud even in the middle of the night (1am, 4 am,...). They planned renovation works during my stay there and gave me a letter of notice (to clean the fridge and not being able to do laundry) on the day they would start...

21403,21403,"Very small, but affordable in a great location for a short stay.
We stayed here for 3 nights. Things to know: You check in online (they call it ‘chat-in’) and get a code to access your room. You can ‘chat-in’ a day before which is helpful. You need to upload a photo of your passport in order to check-in, so having a photo on your phone/computer before checking in is helpful. You check-out (‘chat-out’)online when you leave. 
There are shared facilities on the top floor that we didn’t use.
Most communication with hotel staff is via WhatsApp, so it helps to have this app loaded before booking in. However I found the use of WhatsApp confusing as information didn’t seem to go through to the manager, only to hotel staff.
Pros: comfy bed, good hot shower, great hotel ground staff (e.g. quick to fix minor issues like noisy pipes, broken lift, providing a power adapter). Location is really great - endless food options around, near the Bugis MRT, easy access to airport.
Cons: very small, no window, limited space for large suitcases (but as shown in the photos - you know what you are getting). Fixed hangers and a lack of hooks for towels etc was frustrating. Aircon was good and quiet but blew directly on to the bed which I didn’t like. The building  itself is not secure - anyone can enter the building and lift, although room locks seem very secure. There is an overwhelming (fragrant) smell in the entrance (that may be trying to cover other smells?).

This co living has its own standard such as: the room being cleaned only after 3 nights stay, and must book the day before with no flexibility of time. It left me with the option of just cleaning the room and the bathroom on my own. 
The face of the hotel is at an alley, along with the backdoors of some restaurants so it didn’t smell pleasant and there were rats too. The room was very small and we had ant visitors the very first day on our stay.

Here are the pros
1. Comfortable beds
2. Modern design.
3. Easy check in.
4. Awesome location for food and shopping and sightseeing.
5. Great smart tv options.
6. Big real fridge upstairs to leave your food.
7. Very good host and hotel communication.
The overall experience was 5 stars, but there are things to note that didn’t go as expected.
1. The unit we got didn’t have the layout of any of the photos on the airbnb ad.
2. The hot water did not really work well. It was very glitchy. Like not working night or 2 at all except for 2 min worth of hot water. It was dissappointing after a long day of traveling or futbol. For night 3 and 4 we found it helpful to turn the water to half pressure to keep the hot water to 5 min and you can reset the hot water by turning on the sink water to hot then turning it off.
3. The hotel is surrounded by construction. There was a really loud machine operating almost all night next to our window. It made it hard to fall asleep.
4. When you type in the location in grab, you are dropped at the main street, but have to walk around to the back alley with your luggage/stroller etc.
5. There is no safe locked room to keep your luggage after you check out. It sits in the lobby unattended most of the day.
6. The blankets had holes in them.
7. The aircon didn’t hold consistently.

I did not know that. I couldn’t imagine that some hotels which serve only 5hours stay show up when I search one night stay hotel.

The hotel’s fault is just adopting complicated system. Moreover, the self check-in system is also complicated. That made me a bit irritated.

1. Inaccuracy- they put washer/dryer as amenities on the listing descriptions but they don’t offer it for free, you need to pay S$8 each. 
Also, they don’t provide daily cleaning service like as the other hotels do. You will find this info only when you check-in and try to find out the cleaning information on the TV screen. So among my 4 nights of stay, I only was eligible to get one time cleaning service, yet they didn’t provide it, claiming “do not disturb” sign was on. I have no idea but even if in case I turned on by mistake, they left note at 16:42 according to their note, but said I need to request until 4pm to get the service. (so the eligible time was already passed) They didn’t notify me via Airbnb web or text, so how can I even know? 
I went to concierge to request at least next day cleaning, and they said it’s very strictly impossible. 
They are charging S$60+ 10%+7% for additional cleaning, yet took away my granted only one time of cleaning. 
2.Cleanliness- Generally it was OK but upon check-in, there was a black long hair on the pillow. It was not mine obviously since currently I have blonde hair. 
3.Communication- I never can receive reply from the host on Airbnb application. Also, when I asked support regarding inaccurate info about washer/dryer/and cleaning service, the concierge was not helping at all.

The mall is practically ‘in the backyard’, therefore quick easy access to shops, the supermarket and eating places. The bus stop which takes us to the nearest subway station is a only 2-3 minutes’ walk away. 
The one thing that ‘dented’ an otherwise flawless experience would be the communication. The check in details were quite vague and so I asked for more details as I was checking in after midnight on a weekend. There was no response to that and to subsequent messages I sent. It was extremely unsettling for my children and me.

23289,23289,"I stayed two nights at this hotel chain. some good, some bad experiences. 
the good: this specific chain's location is perfect, and the room was clean and new/modern. room will be considered cramped to many westerners but for me coming from HK, I'm used to it. bed is comfy. 
now, the bad: first, the room doesn't block noise from outside much as I can hear not just neighbors but also the ding dong sound the elevator makes. my room is closest to elevator so perhaps other rooms will be better. 
the second and bigger to me is the staff do not communicate well. after I booked I got a message from ""host"" on Airbnb telling me to download the app that is required to check in and unlock room door. the note says I can pre register up to six days before I check in. I kept trying to do this over course of two days but the app wouldn't load. I told the host this but we concluded maybe it's because I'm in Europe at the time. so I land in Singapore on day of check in and I still couldn't get in the app. at this point I'm nervous because I am due to arrive to hotel in one hour and I still can't get app to work. I message host again, he tells me to restart my phone (a pointless advice I've done already. I tell him it doesn't work, he gives me a WhatsApp number to message. I send a message there, the person sees my message but does not respond. 
finally I arrive at hotel still having not resolved app issue, only to realize the app CAN ONLY BE USED WHEN CONNECTED TO THE WIFI AT THE HOTEL. so basically all that info about pre registering days before is wrong information. I understand mistakes happen, but the lack of communication after really made me mad. to ignore messages from someone who's already landed in Singapore and on way to the hotel is terrible service.",0.6904080756786491,2.5791666666666666,2.925273504402771,0.0400258247055679,0.0658620513293752,0.9999775886535645,NEGATIVE,0.0316666666666667,-0.0765923738295213,0.4179216477745806,0.5676666666666667

pros: 
- good location, easy access to things
- bed is comfy, tv has Netflix 
cons:
- check in process a pain. they want you to use this app that's buggy and registering in the app took 15 mins and still didn't work so they finally just gave me a code to unlock.  the app is just not good. 
- room can hear noise from outside easily. and there was construction happening outside street

Also, I feedback twice for the potential fire hazard due to charging battery operated foldable bike at the corridor. Bike was removed almost immediate after feedback, but appearing again the next day, meaning overnight charging. This hotel is shophouse with narrow corridor, and many fire incidents about overnight charging bike.

23508,23508,"Second time staying at one a ST Signature location. The only reason my review for this is 4 stars is because of my previous experience at the Tanjong Pagar location which was excellent.
Unfortunately, when I checked into my room, I found an empty trash bag with a facemask which was soaking wet right at the doorstep once entering the room. The carpet in the room was also visibly stained and looked like it could do with some deep cleaning. I also found the bathroom and toilet to be less hygienic compared to the Tanjong Pagar location. Additionally, the lighting within the room and the loudness of the airconditioning at the Chinatown location is worse compared to the Tanjong Pagar location.
For the price, it is definitely worth the stay and I would have probably gave 5 stars as well if it wasn't for my excellent experience at the Tanjong Pagar location.

Positives:
- The host was the most responsive host I have ever had. Replied straight away when I had questions. 10/10 for the messaging service.
- checkin and having your key on the app was really good
- great location! So close to everything by walking distance
- room was nice and cold, also very dark.
Negatives:
- the kitchen and bathrooms were a bit dirty. It was very much hostel vibes. If I came here for travelling and it was a hostel, then I would accept it however I came for business and it’s not detailed as a hostel so I expected better living conditions. I appreciate its lower price that most accomodation however it’s much more price wise that a hostel would be so I didn’t think the living conditions matched the price enough.

Our main feedback to the host was that the room and in fact the whole place felt so damp, maybe because of AC running all the time and no window / extraction for the rooms. The pillow case sheets felt damp when we arrived and you could see evidence of mould spores on the door and it just smelled really damp everywhere, which we weren’t keen on as have asthma.

We had trouble checking in also, as the app that you must compare a selfie taken at the Hotel site, against the picture in your passport (a copy is recorded during check in). We had trouble with this, as according to the app, I didn’t resemble the picture enough. We did eventually get past this. 
In all honesty, if not for the fact that we had been travelling through three countries over thirty hours, and not slept in two days we likely would’ve found somewhere else to stay.

Overall, I had a good experience. Communication was good. Location was good. Access was easy. It was fairly quiet and a good amount of privacy, all things considered. The bathroom area got flooded one night and it took a while for that to be cleaned up, but overall the place was kept fairly clean.
The two things I struggled the most with was the Wi-Fi and the smell. Because of the heat and humidity, the bathroom area wasn't very well ventilated. There's a small window that's opened but instead of exhausting the moisture from the inside, it's really just mixing it with the humidity and heat from the outside, causing a mildew smell that I had a very hard time with. I'm not sure if much can be done here. Inside the room and the communal sitting area near the kitchen/lobby, you don't notice the smell. On the other hand, the Wi-Fi was very unstable and unreliable. A lot of times it just wouldn't connect, not matter which SSID you used. And if it did, it was generally pretty slow. I was trying to use my cell service but in my pod/room area, the signal wasn't great for that either.
Overall, it was a good experience. Oh, if you need to do your laundry, you need to buy your own laundry detergent. I went out and got the smallest pack possible even though I only used it once.

Just nothing was great - except for the self check-in which was smooth and the digital key is useful. My experience was obviously specific to my needs, the room I was allocated and the time I stayed but here are my observations - the room was not as clean as it could be, just needs a bit of extra attention to the bathroom and wiping surfaces. The real challenge for me was the noise - there is very little soundproofing so you can hear a lot of what people in the adjacent units are doing - in my case this included a lot of doors banging late at night and early in the morning. It just wasn't the most relaxing place to stay, but if you're out and about all day and just need a convenient spot to sleep and shower then this would be fine.

Only hitch was the check-in. Singapore are very strict on short term rentals so all these places have to operate under some kind of hotel business model. This involves downloading the company's app, submitting all your passport info, etc just like checking in for a flight. And just like checking in for a flight, theapp works differently on different phones, it's buggy, it's not clear which bitsyou do at which time, and so on. Overall it ended just fine so if you need a basic, budget space with great facilities in a central location then this is hard to beat. But there are a few frictions with the check-in process. I recommend having the app downloaded and having the WiFi info saved ahead of time so that you can at least get to the building and then all you have to do is connect to the WiFi, open the app and check in.

They have a cleaner (who is not very good at all) so I outsourced to Urban Company.

To reach the loft and bed there, one would have to walk through the other “bedroom”. This means one guest will be walking through the other’s bedroom area to get to the kitchen, bathroom, etc.
There are three ACs in the unit but the remote control was missing for one and we could not control the temperature or turn it off. Eventually had to reach out to front desk again so it wasn’t absolutely freezing in the home.
The communication process was just so lacking. Often they wouldn’t really answer your questions and would respond in a way that made little sense. 
There is a washer in the unit but we bought our own detergent after the front desk replied that “detergent was added automatically” to the washer which wasn’t true.
The water heater is controlled by a switch by the bathroom. Be sure this is turned on or you won’t have hot water. We learned later it’s customary in Singapore to turn the water heater on/off when you need it. But this isn’t mentioned at all in the house instructions or check-in process so just bare in mind.
There is also ongoing construction right outside the building. Looks like they’re building a high rise?
If you need to drop off your bags early, keep in mind that the system is not incredibly secure: you are simply leaving your luggage in the office entry way that is often unmanned and is accessible to all other Airbnb guests. Singapore is very safe, but I’d still be careful since the AirBnB has lots of travelers coming in and out.

- Excellent location, close to multiple MRT stations and many cute cafes and eateries, you will fall in love with Singapore if you stay here and get to explore the area 
- reasonably clean and well kept
Cons:
- twice during our stay, staff walked into the unit without knocking or announcing themselves. It was extremely jarring and inappropriate 
- the compound seems to be quite new, so many amenities that were promised for the unit either came late or never came (microwave, fridge, tv, laundry)
- the staff were very hard to get hold of if we needed anything. Nobody was manning the front desk
-  we requested late check out which they agreed to when we booked. However, on our last day the staff showed up and rudely demanded that we leave at the regular check out time because the room needed to be readied for the next guest. After some back and forth they shifted us to a different room just for the afternoon so they could accommodate their other guests. The other room had no amenities whatsoever and we were given less than 30 mins to pack and vacate, which was very hectic. Due to their poor management practises, we were hassled. 
- the laundry machine in the compound needs five new one dollar coins for one load (so ten dollars for one wash and one dry). It is very inconvenient to try to source ten new dollar coins every time we need to do laundry.

For others looking to book a stay, be aware of the following: 
1) if you book the attic room, you would have to walk up a flight of stairs to access the room because the elevator does not go up all the way to that floor. This makes it inconvenient  because I had luggage that I had to carry up and walk up stairs everytime I entered and left my room. Also knowing this information would be helpful becuase I had booked with a disabled guest. 
Additionally, the wifi is incredibly horrible in the room. I would not be able to access it from the bedroom and get extremely spotty service in the living room. There are certain spots in the living room where the wifi doesn’t work at all. Be aware if you think wifi is important during your stay.
